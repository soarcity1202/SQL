--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--I found the music that would be most suitable for club music based off of the tempo which is 130 bpm or higher
SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo >= 130
ORDER BY tempo DESC

--I decided to add danceabilty into the query due to it measuring the regularity of the song
SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo >= 130
AND danceability > 0.5
ORDER BY tempo DESC

--I wanted to pull the top 10 Artists based on popularity 
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

--I wanted to find the average energy of the top ten songs 
SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
